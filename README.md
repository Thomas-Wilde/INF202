# INF202 - Software Engineering
This is a repository for the lecture **INF202 -- Software Engineering**. The
course is taught in the summer term at the TAU in Istanbul. The repository
contains some small tasks that provide useful insights into the lecture's
content.

# Task01 -- Version Control
## Indexed Image

In the folder `task01`, you can find files for a project to generate an indexed
image from given data. The data is shared over the e-learning system. All you
should do is place the data file in the running folder and run the program from
this folder

### C++ Version
In the subfolder `c++`, you can find the solution written in C++. A
`CMakeLists.txt` is provided, so if you want, you can create a project for the IDE of your choice using [CMake](https://cmake.org/).

### Java Version
You can find the solution in Java in the subfolder `java`.
Either compile the classes by hand or create a project in the IDE of your choice.

### Python Version
The subfolder `python` provides the version written in Python. You do not need to compile it; just run it in your Python environment.

### ToDo - Features:
- [x] provide further languages
  - [x] C++
  - [x] Python
  - [x] Java
- [ ] implement useful unit tests
- [ ] document the code better
